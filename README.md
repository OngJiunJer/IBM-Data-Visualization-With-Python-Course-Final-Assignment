# IBM-Data-Visualization-With-Python-Course-Final-Assignment
This project consists of two parts:

- Part 1: Creating visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium.
- Part 2: Creating a dashboard with Plotly and Dash using Skills Network Labs (SN Labs), which is a virtual lab environment.

This repository serves as a reference for me to recap the concepts and techniques learned during the course.
